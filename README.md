###### Firefox word replacer for Vim

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a super powerful text editor which you should definitely [learn to use](https://www.openvim.com/).

It does however, have a bit of a reputation as a running joke in online dev communities, and gets mentioned a lot either as a running joke, or by people who use Vim trying to defend its usefulness.

I got sick of seeing it mentioned so much, so I created this custom Firefox extension to replace all instances of the word 'Vim', with whatever word I fancy seeing more of that particular day.

**Throwaway project. Not tested on any other devices/browers apart from my own.
